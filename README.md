# General info
Concept for this app is to make traveling easier. How do I want to achieve that? <br>
When I travel to a place, I want to learn the stories behind the things I see. I need some context: what happened there, why someone decided to build it, or even just some fun facts.
Currently, to get that information, I have to check the name of a building or location on a map, search for it on Google, and then find a website with a travel guide. I think this process should be easier. <br>
My app will combine maps and articles in one place. The community will be able to add posts about the places they've visited and rate articles created by other users, helping to rank posts higher or lower.
If you're just walking through a city, you can open the app and instantly learn a lot about the places around you.
